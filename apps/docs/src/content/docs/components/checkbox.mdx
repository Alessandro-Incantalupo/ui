import Checkbox from '../../../components/elements/Checkbox.astro'


The `Checkbox` element is used to easily render an [HTML Checkbox](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_checkbox.asp) that also comes with a required `label` and optional `required` prop.

## Props
```ts
interface Props {
  label?: string
  required?: boolean
}

const { label, required } = Astro.props
```

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| label | None | Text shown after the checkbox, you can also provide through slot. |
| required | false | Whether the checkbox is required to continue |

## Example code
```js title="index.astro"
<Checkbox>
  I agree to the terms and conditions as set out by the user agreement.
</Checkbox>
```

<Window>
  <Checkbox>
    I agree to the terms and conditions as set out by the user agreement.
  </Checkbox>
</Window>

:::note
When using slot, users can no longer click the text to check the checkbox.
