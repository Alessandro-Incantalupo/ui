**We reverse-engineered modern design.** Have a look at [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/), [Lexington](https://lexingtonthemes.com/), [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/), and many others. They all look beautifull - but be honest - a bit similar too. And that is not a bad thing! It just means that they all follow a specific set of rules to make stuff look good.

What happens when you study those for tens of hours? Heck, make that hundreds!  That's exactly what we did, and we started to recognize patterns that we used to build this design system.

Lots and lots of thanks to the creators of the mentioned libraries. They did a great job, and we are grateful for their work üôè
