## Prop values

Prop values differ per component. Below are the possible values for this prop.

### `carousel`

Structures children (often Cards) in a carousel.

<Box class:list={'not-content'} structure="carousel">
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
</Box>

### `column`

Structures children in a vertical stack and sets dynamic margins between them.

:::note
This sets different margins depending on which children follow which. Not all have been set, those will fall back to a default margin.
:::

<Box class:list={'not-content'} structure="column">
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
</Box>

### `grid`

Structures children (often Cards) in a grid.

:::note
Since this component is meant to be displayed full-width, the preview on this page might not be fully representative. Mainly in terms of columns.
:::

<Box class:list={'not-content'} structure="grid">
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
</Box>

### `masonry`

Structures children (often Cards) in a masonry.

:::note
Since this component is based on css `columns` rather than grid, it behaves differently. For example, content is distributed in a top-to-bottom, then left-to-right manner.
:::

<Box class:list={'not-content'} structure="masonry">
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
</Box>

### `split`

Equal columns above a certain breakpoint, based on CSS grid.

<Box class:list={'not-content'} structure="split">
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
</Box>

### `spread`

Structures children in a row with space between them and wrapping.

<Box class:list={'not-content'} structure="spread">
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
  <Card>Card</Card>
</Box>
