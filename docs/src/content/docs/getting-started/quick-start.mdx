description: A quickstart on how to begin using FullUI.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Loops from '../../../components/Loops.html';

Follow the steps below to get started in 5 minutes, and a professional website in an hour.

## Installation
Run one of the following commands to install fullui into your project:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install @fulldevlabs/fullui
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @fulldevlabs/fullui
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @fulldevlabs/fullui
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage
Fullui features a **Design System** and **Component Library**. The design system is a very early versuib, and basically is just CSS variables at the moment. It is used for sizing and theming. The component library is a set of components which are built using the design system.

:::note
We are working on a more robust design system, which can be easily installed and customized via an Astro integration. Stay tuned for that.

### Design System 
The design system is enabled via a simple Astro integration. More on this later, but here is the quickest way to start using it:

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import { fullui } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui/astro'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui(),
  ],
})
```

### Components
Fullui is made to be versatile. Below are different ways to use the same component. All components have this same syntax

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Button href="/">Click me</Button>
<Button href="/" button="Click me"/>
<Button button={{
  button: "Click me",
  href: "/"
}}/>
<Button 
  button={{
    button: "Click me",
    href: "/"
  }}
/>
```

:::note[Why two ways?]
The first one might be nice when hardcoding the text, but the second one works better when text comes from a CMS or Astro Content Colelctions.

## Typescript
Most of Fullui is typed, and the parts that are not yet, will for sure be. You can use the component types using the new Astro ComponentProps type utility, [released in V4.3](https://astro.build/blog/astro-430/#add-componentprops-type-utility). Here is an example:

```astro
---
import type { ComponentProps } from 'astro/types';
import { Button } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'

type ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof Button>
---

<Button href="/">Click me</Button>
```
