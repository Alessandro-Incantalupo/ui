A smart component which can render as different html elements, aplies styling classes, and only renders when it actually has content.

Allmost every component in Fullui uses this component, you probably don't need it yourself often.

## Props
```ts
interface Props {
  as?: HTMLTag
  class?: HTMLAttributes<HTMLTag>['class']
  id?: HTMLAttributes<HTMLTag>['id']
  compact?: boolean | null
  scheme?: 'light' | 'dark' | null
  color?: 'base' | 'accent' | null
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | null
}
```
