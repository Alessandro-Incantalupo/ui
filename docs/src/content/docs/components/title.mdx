The `Button` element is self explanatory, it is a button that receives props from where the element is being called.
## Props
```ts
interface Base extends ComponentProps<typeof Icon>, HTMLAttributes<'a'> {
  look?: 'solid' | 'soft' | 'ghost' | null
  hue?: 'accent' | 'base' | null
  text?: string | null
}

const { look = 'solid', hue = 'accent', text } = Astro.props
```


## Examples
### Color
```astro live
---
import { Title } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Title>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title=>   
<Title color="accent">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title=>  
```

### Contrast
```astro live
---
import { Title } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Title contrast={false}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title=>   
<Title contrast={false} color="accent">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title=>  
```

### Size
```astro live
---
import { Title } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Title size="large">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title>   
<Title size="medium">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title>  
<Title size="small">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title>   
```

### Compact
*It might seem weird having sizes and also compact, but it has a lot of benefits. More on this later*
```astro live
---
import { Title } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Title size="large" compact>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title>   
<Title size="medium" compact>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title>  
<Title size="small" compact>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Title>   
```
