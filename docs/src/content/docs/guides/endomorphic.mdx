title: Endomorphic
---

Fullui introduces a new concept: Endomorpic props. It allows you to pass props in different ways, especially usefull when working with CMS data.

## Examples
```astro
---
import { Button } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<!-- Regular use -->
<Button href="/">Click me</Button>

<!-- Keep your CMS schema flat and self-explenatory -->
<Button href="/" button="Click me"/>

<!-- Useful when dealing with more nested CMS schemas-->
<Button button={{
  button: "Click me",  
  href: "/"
}}/>

<!-- When you want to seperate content from styling -->
<Button 
  button="Click me"
  _button={{
    size: "3",
  }}
/>

<!-- All gets deep-merged, with underscore having lowest priority -->
<Button 
  button={{
    button: "Click me",
    href: "/"
  }}
  _button={{
    button: "Default button text",
    size: "3",
  }}
/>
```
