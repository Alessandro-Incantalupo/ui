The design system is enabled via a simple Astro integration. More on this later, but here is the quickest way to start using it:

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import { fullui } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui/astro'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui(),
  ],
})
```
