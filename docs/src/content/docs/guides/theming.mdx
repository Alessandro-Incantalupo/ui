## Installation
The design system is enabled via a simple Astro integration. More on this later, but here is the quickest way to start using it:

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import { fullui } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui/astro'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui(),
  ],
})
```

## Props
Fullui uses a helper component to pass certain attributes to other components, so that you are able to customize the sizes and colors of these components. 

But it depends on the component if it accepts one of these theming props.

```ts
scheme?: 'light' | 'dark' | null
compact?: boolean | null
color?: 'base' | 'accent' | null
size?: '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | null
contrast?: boolean | null
```

### Scheme
Choose between light or dark mode for your project.

### Color
Choose between the base or accent color to use on the component.

### Contrast
Choose if you want a higher contrast on your component.

### Size
Changes the size of the component.

### Compact
Compacts the size of the component. Also usable with size. 

The reason compact is usable with size is
