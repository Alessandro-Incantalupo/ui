Most of Fullui is typed, and the parts that are not yet, will for sure be. You can use the component types using the new Astro ComponentProps type utility, [released in V4.3](https://astro.build/blog/astro-430/#add-componentprops-type-utility). Here is an example:

```astro
---
import type { ComponentProps } from 'astro/types';
import { Button } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui';

type ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof Button>;
---

<Button href="/">Click me</Button>
```
