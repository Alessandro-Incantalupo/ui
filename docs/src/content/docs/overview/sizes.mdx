Sizes are set in a similar way as colors, using CSS variables.

This way we can leverage the power of cascading, which means that a size applies to all children as well.

For example; we can set a size on a bocks and have everything inside it scale accordingly; buttons, cards, headings, spacing etc.

## Responsiveness

By default, all sizing values are responsive. The values have been hand-picked and we think they work really well.
However, we can understand if some people won't like this, so are exploring ways to make this optional.

## Customizing sizes

While you can change the css variables for sizes, you probably wont have to. If you want to go in on how this works, please checkout the `sizes.css` file in the repository.

For now the only one you probably have to change is `--border-radius`, which sets a multiplier factor.

From that point it is determined by the `size` and `density` of the component.

```css
:root {
  --border-radius: 1;
}
```

## Using densities

Each component accepts a `density` prop. It changes the underlying values used by the `size` prop, for this component and **all its children**.

There are two predifined densities: `base` and `compact`.

For example, we set `compact` on a card and can now size this and all children automatically based on the `size` on the wrapping block/section.

The component documenation pages include visual examples of the different densities.

## Using sizes

Each component accepts a `size` prop too. This sets the size for the spacing, font etc for this component and **all its children**.

The component documenation pages also include visual examples of the different sizes.
