**Components** and a **design system** built to take full advantage of Astro's power.

:::caution
Fullui is currently a work-in-progress and is **not** yet ready for production use. We are working very hard to get it ready as possible. 

In the meantime, please report as many bugs as possible, and request as many features as you would like (no annoying reproductions required,   pinky promise) You can do so here: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fulldevlabs/fullui/issues)
:::

While many libraries focus on applications, Fullui focusses on __content / commerce / marketing__ websites. It aims to provide everything you need to build an entire website that automatically looks good, while still looking unique.

Let's get started! ðŸš€
