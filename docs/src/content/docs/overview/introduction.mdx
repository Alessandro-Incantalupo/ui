###### Ever feel like modern websites are starting to look the same? We do, and we like it!

Content-driven websites are supposed to transmit information, which we believe is best done through minimal and logical design. 

This, combined with Astro unique rendering, gave the opportunity to build 'automated' components, that are still customizable.
<br/>
###### What do you mean by automated and customizable?
- Layouts, sizes and colors that automatically adapt and look good
- Flat components that accept polymorphic props, just like html elements
