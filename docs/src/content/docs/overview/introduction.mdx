Fullui is a component library built to take full advantage of Astro's power.

:::note
Fullui is currently in public beta. Please expect bugs, breaking changes and lots of improvements.

In the meantime, feel free to [create a Github issue](https://github.com/fullui/ui/issues) for anything that raises your mind.
:::

While many libraries focus on applications, Fullui focusses on __content / commerce / marketing__ websites. It aims to provide everything you need to build an entire website that automatically looks good, while still looking unique.

Let's get started! ðŸš€
