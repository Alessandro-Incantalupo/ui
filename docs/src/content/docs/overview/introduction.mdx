Fulldev UI focusses on content-driven websites, rather than applications. It introduces features that originate from 3 beliefs:

###### 1. Modern websites are starting to look the same, and that is great!

Content-driven websites are supposed to transmit information, which we believe is best done with minimal and logical design.

This gives the opporinity for components with which you can create entire websites that automatically look good, no matter your design skills.

###### 2. Moving javascript to the build or server creates opportunities.

This way we can use javascript as a templating language, conditionally rendering components only if they actually have content, without shipping any javascript to the client.

This means we can determine the layouts of our pages from our Astro content collections or a headless CMS.

###### 3. CSS cascading is powerful.

While cascading can be annoying too, it is very powerful when used the right way in combination with CSS variables.

We can create components that adjust to their environment. Like a Heading component that changes its size and font being in a section versus a card.
