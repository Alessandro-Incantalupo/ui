Fullui features a design system used in each component. Some parts can be configured globally, while others can be configured per component using props.

## Global config
Global configuration is set by passing an object to fullui integration.

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import fullui from '@fullui/ui/integration'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui({
      color: {},
      size: {},
      font: {},
      theme: {},
    }),
  ],
})
```


### Color
Fullui uses Radix Colors under the hood. You can define an alias and a value. For all available radix palettes, [see their documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).
```ts
color: {
  accent: 'indigo',
  base: 'slate',
  // or choose any key you like
  // the last item is used as the default color
}, 
```

### Size
All spacing in Fullui is fully responsive and highly dynamic. The value you enter is a multiplier, so we recommend using values between 0.75 and 1.25.

```ts
  scale: 1, // Applies to everything
  space: 1, // Applies to margin and padding
  radius: 1,  // Applies to border radius
  text: 1, // Applies to font size
```
{/* ### Theme

```ts
theme: {
  border: '1px',
},  
``` */}

### Font
All Google fonts are avaiable through the Fullui theming, and ofcourse others can be configured through regular css.

We use [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/) to import them privacy-friendly and fast. 
```ts
font: {
  heading: 'Open Sans:700',
  subheading: 'Open Sans:500',
  text: 'Open Sans:400',
  subtext: 'Open Sans:400',
  button: 'Open Sans:500',
},    
```

### Theme
This part of the global configuration is a work-in-progress. For now it only accepts a border-width.

```ts
theme: {
  border: '1px',
},    
```

## Component props
Every component in Fullui used the [Tag component](/utility/tag), which allows them to take a base set of props. 

### Scheme
Switch between light or dark mode. Cascades down to all children.
```ts
scheme?: 'light' | 'dark
```

### Color
Choose one of the colors that you've set in your global color config. Cascades down to all children.
```ts
color?: keyof globalConfig.color // for example 'accent' or 'base'
```

### Contrast
Increase the contrast of this component.
```ts
contrast?: boolean
```

### Size
:::tip[Unique feature]
Because of the cascading nature of how sizes are applied in Fullui, you can set the site for an entire section and scale everything accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc.
:::
Change the size of the component. Everythings scales accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc.

Cascades down to all children.
```ts
size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
```

### Compact
:::tip[Unique feature]
You can use the same component in different contexts and still have the option to choose between small, medium or large. Everything scales accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc. 
:::
This settings works in combination with the size prop. You primarily use this in card-like components.

Example: it allows you to use the same Heading component in a Card as well as in a Section. In both cases you still have the option to choose between small, medium or large. Everythings scales accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc.

Cascades down to all children.
```ts
compact?: boolean
```
