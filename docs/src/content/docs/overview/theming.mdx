Theming is done using CSS variables. This way we can leverage the power of cascading and inheritance.

## Colors

We use a simple `background`, `foreground` `border`and `state` naming convention for colors.

```css
:root {
  --base-background: #fff;
  --base-foreground: #020202;
  --base-border: #d3d3d3;
  --base-state: #fff;
}
```

#### Dark mode

Dark mode is applied by simply swapping the colors in a `full-dark` class.

```css
.full-theme-dark {
  --base-background: #020202;
  --base-foreground: #fff;
  --base-border: #333333;
  --base-state: #101010;
}
```

You can do this not only for a dark theme, but for any theme you like.

#### Variants

Using variants we can swap those 3 colors for others. The following variants are available.

##### panel

Slightly increases visual hierarchy. Used primarily for cards and other panels.

```
--raised-background: #101010;
--raised-foreground: #fff;
--raised-border: #333333;
--raised-state: #101010;
```

##### muted

Slightly decreased visual hierarchy. Used primarily for lower contrast text elements.

```
--muted-background: #020202;
--muted-foreground: #dcdcdc;
--muted-border: #333333;
--muted-state: #020202;
```

##### Input

Used for input fields.

```
--input-background: #fff;
--input-foreground: #020202;
--input-border: #d3d3d3;
--input-state: #fff;
```

##### Primary

Used for primary buttons and other primary elements.

```
--primary-background: #020202;
--primary-foreground: #fff;
--primary-border: transparent;
--primary-state: #020202;
```

##### Secondary

Used for secondary buttons and other secondary elements.

```
--secondary-background: #f0f0f0;
--secondary-foreground: #020202;
--secondary-border: #d3d3d3;
--secondary-state: #f0f0f0;
```

## Sizes

The size system automatically adapts to it's environment. This means that you can use the same components in different contexts without having to worry about the size.

All values are rem units, so you can set a site-wide scale by setting the `body` font-size. The default value is 16px.

```css
:root {
  font-size: 17.6px; /* 10% increase */
}
```

Sizes also use CSS variables, however, you do not need to customize them. If you want though, please have a look at the source code.

### How to use sizes?

This is explained in defailed on the [Tag](/docs/foundation/tag) component page.
