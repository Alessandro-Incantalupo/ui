Theming is done using CSS variables. This way we can leverage the power of cascading and inheritance.

## Colors
We use a simple `background`, `foreground` and `border` naming convention for colors. Below you see the default values in light mode.

```css
:root {
  --color-base-background: #ffffff;
  --color-base-foreground: #020202;
  --color-base-border: #d3d3d3;
}
```

#### Dark mode
Dark mode is applied by simply swapping the colors in a `full-dark` class.
```css
.full-theme-dark {
  --color-base-background: #ffffff;
  --color-base-foreground: #020202;
  --color-base-border: #ffffff;
}
```
You can do this not only for a dark theme, but for any theme you like. 

#### Variants
Using variants we can swap those 3 colors for others. The following variants are available.

##### Raised
Slightly increases visual hierarchy. Used primarily for cards and other panels.
```
--color-raised-background: #f0f0f0;
--color-raised-foreground: #020202;
--color-raised-border: #d3d3d3;
```

##### Lowered
Slightly decreased visual hierarchy. Used primarily for lower contrast text elements.
```
--color-lowered-background: #fff;
--color-lowered-foreground: #3b3b3b;
--color-lowered-border: #d3d3d3;
```

##### Input
Used for input fields.
```
--color-input-background: #fff;
--color-input-foreground: #020202;
--color-input-border: #d3d3d3;
```

##### Primary
Used for primary buttons and other primary elements.
```
--color-primary-background: #020202;
--color-primary-foreground: #fff;
--color-primary-border: #020202;
```

##### Secondary
Used for secondary buttons and other secondary elements.
```
--color-secondary-background: #f0f0f0;
--color-secondary-foreground: #020202;
--color-secondary-border: #d3d3d3;
```

## Sizes
The size system automatically adapts to it's environment. This means that you can use the same components in different contexts without having to worry about the size. 

All values are rem units, so you can set a site-wide scale by setting the `body` font-size. The default value is 16px.
```css
:root {
  font-size: 17.6px; /* 10% increase */
}
```

Sizes also use CSS variables, however, you do not need to customize them. If you want though, please have a look at the source code.
