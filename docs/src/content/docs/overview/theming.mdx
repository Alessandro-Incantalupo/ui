## Props
Fullui uses a helper component to pass certain attributes to other components, so that you are able to customize the sizes and colors of these components. 

But it depends on the component if it accepts one of these theming props.

### Scheme
Choose between light or dark mode for your project.
```ts
scheme?: string
```

### Color
Choose between the base or accent color to use on the component.
```ts
color?: string
```

### Contrast
Choose if you want a higher contrast on your component.
```ts
contrast?: boolean
```

### Size
Changes the size of the component.
```ts
size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
```

### Compact
Compacts the size of the component. Also usable with size. 
```ts
compact?: boolean
```

## Customizing your configuration
These are all the options you are able to change in your Astro configuration.

### Colors
We use the Radix colors for our components. For all the color options check: https://www.radix-ui.com/colors
```ts
color: {
  accent: 'indigo',
  base: 'slate',
}, 
```

### Sizes
Control default sizes of components.

```ts
size: {
  scale: 1,
  space: 1,
  radius: 1,
  text: 1,
}, 
```
{/* ### Theme

```ts
theme: {
  border: '1px',
},  
``` */}

### Fonts
We use font families from bunny.net for our components. <br /> For more font options check: https://fonts.bunny.net/
```ts
font: {
  heading: 'Open Sans:700',
  subheading: 'Open Sans:500',
  text: 'Open Sans:400',
  subtext: 'Open Sans:400',
  button: 'Open Sans:500',
},    
```
