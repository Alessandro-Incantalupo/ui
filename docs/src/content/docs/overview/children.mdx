With Fullui you are able to render child components or custom elements within other components.


## Example
``` astro live
---
import { Icon, Button } from '@fullui/ui'
---

<Icon name="arrow-right" />

<Button
  href="#"
  html="Click me"
  icon={{
    name: "arrow-right",
  }}
  propEndingWithIcon={{
    name: "arrow-right",
  }}
  randomName={{
    component: 'Icon',
    name: "arrow-right",
  }}
  customElement={{
    tag: "span",
    html: "This is a custom element."
  }}
/>
```

Each component loops over it's props, rendering a child component or element when:

- the prop key is 'html', in which case a html string is rendered
- the prop name ends with a component name and the value is an object, in which case the component is rendered
- the prop value is an object and contains a 'component' key, in which case the component is rendered
- the prop value is an object and contains a 'tag' key, in which case the element is rendered
