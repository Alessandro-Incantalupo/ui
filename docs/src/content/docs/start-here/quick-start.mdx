import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Loops from '../../../components/Loops.html';

Follow the steps below to get started in 5 minutes, and a professional website in an hour.

## Installation
Run one of the following commands to install fullui into your project:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @fulldevlabs/fullui
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @fulldevlabs/fullui
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @fulldevlabs/fullui
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Integration
The design system is enabled via a simple Astro integration. More on this later, but here is the quickest way to start using it:

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import { fullui } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui/astro'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui(),
  ],
})
```

## Components
Fullui is very versatile. Below are different ways to use the same component. These different syntaxes apply to each component in Fullui.

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<!-- Regular use -->
<Button href="/">Click me</Button>

<!-- Keep your CMS schema flat and self-explenatory -->
<Button href="/" button="Click me"/>

<!-- Useful when dealing with more nested CMS schemas-->
<Button button={{
  button: "Click me",  
  href: "/"
}}/>

<!-- When you want to seperate content from styling -->
<Button 
  button="Click me"
  _button={{
    size: "large",
  }}
/>

<!-- All gets deep-merged, with underscore having lowest priority -->
<Button 
  button={{
    button: "Click me",
    href: "/"
  }}
  _button={{
    button: "Default button text",
    size: "large",
  }}
/>
```

## Typescript
Most of Fullui is typed, and the parts that are not yet, will for sure be. You can use the component types using the new Astro ComponentProps type utility, [released in V4.3](https://astro.build/blog/astro-430/#add-componentprops-type-utility). Here is an example:

```astro
---
import type { ComponentProps } from 'astro/types';
import { Button } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'

type ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof Button>
---

<Button href="/">Click me</Button>
```
