title: Rendering Elements
---

With Fullui you are able to render custom elements within other components.

The way this works is by creating a new [Tag](/components/tag) component within the component your using and using. 
After creating the new [Tag](/components/tag) it takes the given key (you can name it however you want) and uses it as a class then filling it up with the given HMTL.

This component is compatible with all components that make use of the [Children](/components/children) component.

## Example
``` astro live
---
import { Writeup } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Writeup
  writeup-paragraph={{
    tag: "p",
    html: "This is a custom paragraph."
  }}
/>
```
