title: Rendering children
---

Every component uses a dynamically rendered child component.

The way this component works is by mapping every key you pass as a component (if the given key exists as a component) allowing you to choose the order of components and which component u want to use.

## Example
``` astro live
---
import { Children } from '@fulldevlabs/fullui'
---

<Children
  title={{html: "This is a component."}}
  tagline={{html: "and this is a component."}}
/>
```
