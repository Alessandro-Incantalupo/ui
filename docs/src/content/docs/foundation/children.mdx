title: Children
description: Astro Children used to dynamically render child components and/or elements based on props.
---

The Children component is used as the foundation of every other components that can have child components. This means all features described here are available on every other component too.

You most likely do **NOT** want to use this component directly.

This component accepts **ANY** props. Some it will ignore though, and some it will render. 

The prop is rendered as a child component if one of the following is true.

#### If `key` ends with a component name
```astro live
---
{/* import { Children } from '@fullui/ui'; */}
---

{/* <Children button={{ text: 'Button' }} /> */}
{/* <Children Button={{ text: 'Button' }} /> */}
{/* <Children primaryButton={{ text: 'Button' }} /> */}
{/* <Children fooButton={{ text: 'Button' }} /> */}
```

#### If `value` contains a `component` key with a component name
```astro live
---
{/* import { Children } from '@fullui/ui'; */}
---

{/* <Children foo={{ component: 'Button', text: 'Button' }} /> */}
```

#### If `value` contains a `as` key with an HTML tag name
In which case the Tag component is used to render the element.

```astro live
---
{/* import { Children } from '@fullui/ui'; */}
---

{/* <Children foo={{ as: 'div', text: 'Text' }} /> */}
```
