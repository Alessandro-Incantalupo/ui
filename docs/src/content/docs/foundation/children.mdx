title: Children
description: Astro Children used to dynamically render child components and/or elements based on props.
---

The Children component is used as the foundation of every other components that can have child components. This means all features described here are available on every other component too.

You most likely do **NOT** want to use this component directly.

## Props
Extends all [Polymorphic props](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#polymorphic-type), as described in the Astro documentation. This means it accepts all regular HTML attributes.

Furthermore, the bwlow props are available.

#### `as` (Polymorphic)
**Type:** `as?: HTMLTag = 'div'`

The as prop is used to define which HTML tag is used to render the components. Based on the value, other HTML attributes are available as props too.

For a details explenation see [Polymorphic props](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#polymorphic-type) in the Astro documentation.

#### `if`
**Type:** `if?: any`

By default the Tag componet only renders when it has a slot passed. This is to prevent empty tags from being rendered and to keep the HTML clean.

If the `if` prop is set, the component will also render when the `if` prop is truthy.


## Examples

import { Children } from '@fullui/ui'
