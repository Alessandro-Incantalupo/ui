The Tag component is used as the foundation of every other component. This means all features described here are available on every other component too.

You most likely do **NOT** want to use this component directly.

## Props
Below props are available on all components.

#### `as` (Polymorphic)
**Type:** `as?: HTMLTag = 'div'`

The as prop is used to define which HTML tag is used to render the components. Based on the value, other HTML attributes are available as props too.

For a details explenation see [Polymorphic props](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#polymorphic-type) in the Astro documentation.

#### `if`
**Type:** `if?: any`

By default the Tag componet only renders when it has a slot passed. This is to prevent empty tags from being rendered and to keep the HTML clean.

If the `if` prop is set, the component will also render when the `if` prop is truthy.

#### `theme`
**Type:** `theme?: 'light' | 'dark' | string`

Switch between light or dark mode. Or any other theme you have defined as explained on the [theming](/docs/overview/theming) page.

**⚠️ This prop cascades down to all children.**

#### `size`
**Type:** `size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' | '2xl'`

Changes the size for spacing, text, radius, etc.

**⚠️ This prop cascades down to all children.**

#### `compact`
**Type:** `compact?: boolean`

Works in combination with size, but sets the distance between steps, rather than the overall size. Meant to be used in card-like layouts.

**⚠️ This prop cascades down to all children.**
