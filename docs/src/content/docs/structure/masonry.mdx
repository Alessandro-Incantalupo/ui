title: Masonry

import ThemeProp from '../../props/ThemeProp.mdx'
import AsProp from '../../props/AsProp.mdx'
import SizeProp from '../../props/SizeProp.mdx'

Structures children (often Cards) in a masonry.

:::note
Since this component is based on css `columns` rather than grid, it behaves differently. For example, content is distributed in a top-to-bottom, then left-to-right manner.
