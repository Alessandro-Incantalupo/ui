:::

All Google fonts are avaiable through the Fullui theming, and ofcourse others can be configured through regular css.

Fullui uses [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/) to import them privacy-friendly and fast. 

## Global config
Add all of the following keys to the `font` object in the Fullui integration. They are automatically applied to the right components.

Use the font name, followed by a colon and **one weight**. For example: `Open Sans:700`.

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import fullui from '@fullui/ui/integration'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui({
      font: {
        heading: 'IMB Plex Sans:700',
        subheading: 'IMB Plex Sans:700',
        text: 'IMB Plex Sans:400',
        subtext: 'IMB Plex Sans:400',
        button: 'IMB Plex Sans:500',
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```
