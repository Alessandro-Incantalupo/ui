Fullui features a unique sizing system. It's designed to work well with content / commerce / marketing websites, where you can have large sections but also small cards.

## Global config
Global configuration is set by passing an object to fullui integration. 

At the moment it only accepts a scale, which is a multiplier applied on all sizing properties. We recommend using values between 0.9 and 1.1.

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import fullui from '@fullui/ui/integration'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui({
      size: {
        scale: 1,
      }
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Component props
Every component in Fullui used the [Tag component](/utility/tag), which allows them to take a base set of props. 

### Size
:::tip[Unique feature]
Because of the cascading nature of how sizes are applied in Fullui, you can set the site for an entire section and scale everything accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc.
:::
Change the size of the component. Everythings scales accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc.

Cascades down to all children.
### Contrast
```astro live
---
import { Button } from '@fullui/ui'
---

<Button size="xl">Button</Button>
<Button size="lg">Button</Button>
<Button size="md">Button</Button>
<Button size="sm">Button</Button>
<Button size="xs">Button</Button>
```
### Compact
:::tip[Unique feature]
You can use the same component in different contexts and still have the option to choose between small, medium or large. Everything scales accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc. 
:::
This settings works in combination with the size prop. You primarily use this in card-like components.

Example: it allows you to use the same Heading component in a Card as well as in a Section. In both cases you still have the option to choose between small, medium or large. Everythings scales accordingly; spacing, fonts, etc.

Cascades down to all children.
```astro live
---
import { Button } from '@fullui/ui'
---

<Button size="xl" compact>Button</Button>
<Button size="lg" compact>Button</Button>
<Button size="md" compact>Button</Button>
<Button size="sm" compact>Button</Button>
<Button size="xs" compact>Button</Button>
```
