Fullui features a design system used in each component. Some parts can be configured globally, while others can be configured per component using props.

## Global config
Global configuration is set by passing an object to fullui integration.

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import fullui from '@fullui/ui/integration'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui({
      color: {},
      font: {},
      size: {},
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Component props
Every component in Fullui used the [Tag component](/utility/tag), which allows them to take a base set of props. The following props are available on every component.

- **Size**: Change the size for spacing, text, radius, etc. Cascades down to all children.
- **Compact**: Works in combination with size, but sets the distance between steps, rather than the overall size. Meant to be used in card-like layouts.
- **Scheme**: Switch between light or dark mode. Cascades down to all children.
- **Color**: Choose the color palette. Cascades down to all children.
- **Contrast**: Increase the contrast of this component.
