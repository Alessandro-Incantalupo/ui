description: How to configure colors in Fullui; a component library and design system built for Astro.
---

Fullui uses Radix Colors under the hood. For all available palettes, [see their documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

## Global config
Global configuration is set by passing an object to the fullui integration.

```ts
// astro.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import fullui from '@fullui/ui/integration'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fullui({
      color: {
        // Choose your palettes, you can name them whatever you want
        accent: 'indigo',
        base: 'slate', // The last one is the default color
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Component props
Every component in Fullui used the [Tag component](/utility/tag), which allows them to take the following color props

### Color
Pass one of the palettes you defined in the global config. This cascades down to all children.
```astro live
---
import { Button } from '@fullui/ui'
---

<Button color="accent"> Button </Button>
<Button color="base"> Button </Button>
```

### Contrast
Increase the contrast of this component. This changes the step of the palette used for text, backgrounds etc

```astro live
---
import { Button } from '@fullui/ui'
---

<Button contrast> Button </Button>
<Button> Button </Button>
```

### Scheme
Switch between light or dark mode. Cascades down to all children. This cascades down to all children, so you probably only set it on sections, pages, or even the entire website.

*Note: this looks better when the background would also change, which it does not in this example. A better way to preview this is to use the light/dark mode switch in the top right corner of this page.*
```astro live
---
import { Button } from '@fullui/ui'
---

<Button color="accent" scheme="light" contrast> Button </Button>
<Button color="accent" scheme="dark" contrast> Button </Button>
```
