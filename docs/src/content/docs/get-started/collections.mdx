:::tip[Unique feature]
These features are possible thanks to Astro's awesome [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) and built-in support for [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas.
:::

## Usage
```ts
// content/config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'
import { pageSchema } from '@fullui/ui'

export const collections = {
  yourcollection: defineCollection({
    type: 'content',
    schema: pageSchema({
      // your configuration options here...
    }),
  }),
}
```

## Options

### nestify
**Type**: `boolean`\
**Default**: `true`

:::caution
Disabling this feature will disable all other features as well, because they rely on this feature.
:::

Changes all flattened keys to nested ones.
```markdown
---
image.src: /image.jpg
# becomes
image:
  src: /image.jpg
---
```

### camelCase
**Type**: `boolean`\
**Default**: `true`

Transforms keys in all possible casing strategies to camelCase.

### mergeUnderscores
**Type**: `boolean`\
**Default**: `true`

Strips all leading underscores. Resulting keys with an equal name will be merged. 
This allows you to do define default values for specific keys:

```markdown
---
_image:
  position: cover
  class: 'my-class'
image:
  src: /image.jpg
  alt: My image
---
```

### layouts
**Type**: `CollectionKey | false`\
**Default**: `layouts`

Looks for a `layout` key in the entry. Then takes the value of the `layout` key and looks for an entry in the specified `layouts` collection.

Let's say you have a products collection with the following entry:
```markdown
// content/products/myproduct.md
---
layout: products
title: My Product
price: 100
---
```

You see we reference a layout called `products`. Make sure you define this layout in a collection called `layouts`:
```markdown
// content/layouts/products.md
---
title: Default Title
checklist:
  - Free shipping
  - Delivered in 1 day
---
```

When you now call `getEntry('products', 'myproduct')`, it automatically returns a deepmerged version of the product and the layout. The entry itself allways has the highest priority, so you can override the layout values.
```markdown
---
checklist:
  - Free shipping
  - Delivered in 1 day
layout: products
title: My Product
price: 100
---
```

### removeNull
**Type**: `boolean`\
**Default**: `true`

Removes all keys with a `false` value.

Removes all `null` values, which is the default in markdown/yaml when you define a key with no value. 
Otherwise your layout data would be overwritten by all those nulls.

You can disable this if your setup allows you to simply not define a key at all, since then it will be undefined instead of null.

### removeFalse
**Type**: `boolean`\
**Default**: `true`

Removes all keys with a `false` value. This way you can disable keys from the received layout.

:::caution
This will result in all keys with a `false` value to be completely removed from the entry.

## Using types
Astro does a lot of typing automatically for you, but if you need to use a type manually, you can do that using built-in Astro feaures:

```astro
---
import type {
  CollectionEntry,
  CollectionKey,
  ContentCollectionKey,
  DataCollectionKey,
} from 'astro:content'

type YourCollection = CollectionEntry<'yourcollection'>
type GenericCollection = CollectionEntry<CollectionKey>
type ContentCollection = CollectionEntry<ContentCollectionKey>
type DataCollection = CollectionEntry<DataCollectionKey>
---
```
