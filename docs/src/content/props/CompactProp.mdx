**Type:** `compact?: boolean`

Changes the underlying values used by the `size` prop, for this component and **all its children**.

For example, we set `compact` on a card and can now size this and all children automatically based on the `size` on the wrapping block/section.

Choose a predefined density, or a custom value defined like explained in the [theming guide](/overview/theming).
