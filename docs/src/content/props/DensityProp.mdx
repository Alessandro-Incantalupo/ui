**Type:** `density?: 'base' | 'compact' | string`

Changes the underlying values used by the `size` prop, for this component and **all its children**.

For example, we set `compact` on a card and can now size this and all children automatically based on the `size` on the wrapping block/section.

Choose a predifined density, or a custom value defined like explained in the [coors guide](/overview/colors).
