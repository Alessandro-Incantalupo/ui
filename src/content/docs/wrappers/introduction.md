Roots are components that `wrap` around multiple of the same elements. They are usually used inside of elements that can be indentified by ending with `Group` or are plural.

:::caution
All Roots use `cva`, which you can read more about [here](https://cva.style/docs).

## Examples of Roots

`Roots` are used inside of elements that can be indentified by ending with `Group` or are plural, like the ones shown below:

- SocialGroup
- ChannelGroup
- Links
- Specs

## Why use Roots?

Roots are especially useful when you are trying to use the same elements on different pages, but want them to have different styling. `Roots` can be fully customized to your desires using `cva` and the `Fulldev design system`.

You should never have to use `Roots` manually as instead you should be using the elements containing them.
