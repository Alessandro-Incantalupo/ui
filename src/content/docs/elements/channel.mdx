import Channel from '../../../components/elements/channel/Channel.astro'
import Showcase from '../../../components/elements/Showcase.astro'

The `Channel` element is used to display contact/company information. This is currently limited to: `email`, `phone`, `whatsapp` or `address`. These four channels have built-in support for an easier user experience.

:::note[Other contact platforms]
If you want to display other contact platforms (i.e. instagram, facebook etc) use the [`Social`](/elements/social) element instead.
