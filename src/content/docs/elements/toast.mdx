import Toast from '../../../components/elements/Toast.astro'


The `Toast` element is used to give a pop-up message to the user, usually used to give a user a pop-up telling them whether their action was successful or failed.

## Props

```ts
export interface Props {
  title: string
  text?: string
  icon?: string
  show?: boolean
}

const { title, text, icon, show = false } = Astro.props
```

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| title | None | The text on the button |
| text | None | The text shown in the toast message |
| icon | None | Icon put infront of the text in the toast message |
| show | false | Whether the toast is shown immediately |

:::note
The `show` prop does not work currently.
