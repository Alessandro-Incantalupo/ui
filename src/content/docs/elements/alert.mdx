We have implemented a couple default icons with their own background color. These are: `info`, `caution` and `danger`, which you can provide to the `icon` prop.

The element will automatically turn these into their icons. Alternatively you can pass through your own icons. 

FullUI uses the [Tabler Icon Pack](https://icones.js.org/collection/tabler) and you can pass any listed icons through the `icon` prop and it will be used as the icon.
