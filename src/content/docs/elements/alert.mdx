The `Alert` element is used to display a message inbetween your text, this can vary from information, warnings, dangers and custom messages.

## Props
```ts
export interface Props {
  icon?: string
  title?: string
  text?: string
}
```

| Prop  | Default | Purpose |
| ----  | ------- | ------- |
| icon  | None    | Icon shown at the start of Alert. |
| title | None    | Title shown at the top of Alert. |
| text  | None    | Text shown below the title and icon, can also be given through slot. |

## Example code
```js title="Alert.astro"
<Alert icon="info" title="Note">
  This is an alert
</Alert>
```

<Alert icon="info" title="Note">
  This is an alert
</Alert>

### Custom Alert

```js title="index.astro"
<Alert icon="message-circle" title="My alert">
  This is a custom alert
</Alert>
```

<Alert icon="message-circle" title="My alert">
  This is a custom alert
</Alert>

We have implemented a couple default icons with their own background color. These are: `info`, `caution` and `danger`, which you can provide to the `icon` prop.

The element will automatically turn these into their icons. Alternatively you can pass through your own icons. 

FullUI uses the [Tabler Icon Pack](https://icones.js.org/collection/tabler) and you can pass any listed icons through the `icon` prop and it will be used as the icon.
