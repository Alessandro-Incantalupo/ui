The `Dialog` is used to create a pop-up for the user to interact with. It automatically creates a button on your page to open the dialog.

## Props
```ts
interface Props {
  text?: string
  open?: boolean
}

const { text, open = false } = Astro.props
```

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| text | None | Shown as text that a user must click on to display the content |
| open | false | Whether the dialog is open or closed when rendered |

## Example code
```js title="index.astro"
<Dialog>
  This content is shown while the Dialog is open, then hidden again when closed.
</Dialog>
```

<Showcase>
  <Dialog>
    This content is shown while the Dialog is open, then hidden again when closed.
  </Dialog>
</Showcase>

You can also use buttons inside of the slot:
