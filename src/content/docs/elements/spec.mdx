import Spec from '../../../components/elements/spec/Spec.astro'

The `Spec` element is used to show a specification of whatever item you would like. It will add a checkmark infront of the text to show that the specification is included.

Currently it is not possible to add a `cross` to show it is _not included_. This may be added at a later date.

## Props
```ts
export interface Props {
  spec?: string
}
```

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| spec | None | The specification that you want to show |

## Example code

```js
<Spec spec="Lifetime of free cat pictures" />
```

<Spec spec="Lifetime of free cat pictures" />
