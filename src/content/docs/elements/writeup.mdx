The `Writeup` element is typically used for text of cards or articles. It adds default styling to `heading` and `<p>` tags.

There are two kinds of write-up avaible in FullUI: `CardWriteup` and `SectionWriteup`. 
As their name suggests they are used in different situations and have slightly different styling to them.

## Props

Both types of writeup have slightly different props:

### CardWriteup
```ts
interface Props {
  layout?: 'left' | 'center' | 'wide' | null
  class?: string
}

const { layout, class } = Astro.props
```

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| layout | None | The layout of the writeup |
| class | None | Any custom styling classes that you want to add |

### SectionWriteup
```ts
interface Props {
  layout?: 'left' | 'center' | 'split' | 'wide'
  class?: string
}

const { layout, class } = Astro.props
```

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| layout | None | The layout of the writeup |
| class | None | Any custom styling classes that you want to add |

## Example code
