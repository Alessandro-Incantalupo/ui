Elements are usually small files that contain specific parts of code. They are often re-used at various parts in your code.

They can be accessed in any component and are easily imported. This allows for coding quickly and not having to re-write the same code more than once.

## Providing props

You may always provide props to all elements in one of two ways:

**Defining props beforehand**

```astro
<!-- Button.astro -->
---
  import Button from '@components/elements/Button.astro'
  const button = {
    label: "Example",
    href: "https://example.com"
  }
---

<Button {button} />
```

**Providing props directly**

```astro
<!-- Button.astro -->
---
  import Button from '@components/elements/Button.astro'
---

<Button label={"Example"} href={"https://example.com"} />
```

The `Button` element was used as an example. You may use both of these ways when calling any element.
