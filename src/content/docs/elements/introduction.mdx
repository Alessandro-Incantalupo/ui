Elements are usually small files that contain specific parts of code. They are often re-used at various parts in your code.

They can be accessed in anywhere on your website and are easily imported. 
This allows for quick coding and not having to keep rewriting the same part of your code.

## Providing props

Almost all elements support both of these ways of providing props:

### Defining props beforehand

```astro
<!-- Button.astro -->
---
import Button from '@components/elements/Button.astro'
const button = {
  label: "Example",
  href: "https://example.com",
  icon: "arrow-right"
}
---

<Button {button} />
```

<Window>
  <Button text="Example" icon="arrow-right" href="https://example.com" />
</Window>

### Providing props directly

```astro
<!-- Button.astro -->
---
import Button from '@components/elements/Button.astro'
---

<Button label="Example" icon="arrow-right" href="https://example.com" />
```

<Window>
  <Button text="Example" icon="arrow-right" href="https://example.com" />
</Window>

The `Button` element was used as an example. You may use both of these methods for most elements.
