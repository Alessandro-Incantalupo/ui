description: An introduction to the docs of the Fullui Astro Component library
---

Fullui is component library and design system for Astro with powerfull features that you probably **have not seen in other libraries before**.

:::danger
Fullui is currently a work-in-progress and is **not** yet ready for production use. We are working very hard to get it ready as possible. 

In the meantime, please report as many buygs as you can find, and request as many features as you would like (no annoying reproductions required,   pinky promise) You can do so here: [GitHub Issues](https://full.dev)
:::

While many libraries focus on application development, Fullui focusses on marketing websites. It aims to provide a set of components that are easy to use, and allow you to create webistes that just look good, even if you are not a designer.

Let's take a look! ðŸš€

#### Stay tuned for updates :)
