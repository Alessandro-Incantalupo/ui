FullUI is a component library developed by Fulldev to make your webdevelopment experience easier than ever before.

The project is open source to allow for community improvements & a free component library **for you**.

Components are building blocks of your websites. Our components are written in [Astro](https://astro.build/) and use the Fulldev design system made with [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) and custom classes.
