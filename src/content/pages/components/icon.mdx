While currently only [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/) are supported, this component does not need any integration or setup.

If you want to use more different icons, we advise you to use the awesome [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon#readme) package (which does require an Astro integration setup though).

## Examples

### `name`

For all available icons see https://tablericons.com/.

```astro live
---
import { Icon } from 'fulldev-ui'
---

<Icon name="circle" />
<Icon name="arrow-right" />
<Icon name="brand-x" />
<Icon name="brand-github" />
```

### `size`

<SizeProp />

```astro live
---
import { Icon } from 'fulldev-ui'
---

<Icon size="sm" name="circle" />
<Icon size="md" name="circle" />
<Icon size="lg" name="circle" />
```
