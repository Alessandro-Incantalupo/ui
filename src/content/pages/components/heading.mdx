Heading sizes are handpicked to match the body text size. The sizes are also responsive, where the larger sizes respond more than the smaller ones.

```astro live
---
import Heading from 'fulldev-ui/components/Heading.astro'
---

<Heading size="xs">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="sm">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="md">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="lg">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
```

Levels behave similar to sizes, but they also set the html tag being used. For example, level 1 is the same as as="h1".

This way you can have a section with size `lg` for example, which a h1 till h6 that automatically have the right sizes.

```astro live
---
import Heading from 'fulldev-ui/components/Heading.astro'
---

<Heading level={1}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading level={2}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading level={3}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading level={4}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading level={5}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading level={6}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
```

Set to `true` by default on Headings, which you can override by setting it to `false`.

```astro live
---
import Heading from 'fulldev-ui/components/Heading.astro'
---

<Heading>The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
<Heading contrast={false}>The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
```
