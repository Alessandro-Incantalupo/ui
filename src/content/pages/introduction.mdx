##### Build entire websites with just components

Fulldev UI is unique in that it introduces larger components to build entire pages, and even websites. We also have blocks that can be used to build entire sections of a page within minutes using just props.

##### Integrates with any JS / CSS framework

Want to use Tailwind, or something else? You can overwrite all styles. Need an interactive framework component? Styles can be applied with one simple class.

##### Automated colors, spacing and sizes

Everything is carefully designed to be fully responsive. Component adapt to their environment, like a Heading being different in a Section than in a Card. You can also customize via simple props.
